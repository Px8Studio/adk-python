    "\n",
    "- **Fundamental Agent & Tools**: You started by building a \"Day Trip Genie\" and equipped it with its first tool, GoogleSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Function Tools**: You gave your agent a new sense by creating a custom tool to fetch live data from the U.S. National Weather Service API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent-as-a-Tool**: You orchestrated a sophisticated hierarchy where agents delegate tasks to other, more specialized agents, creating a collaborative team.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Power of Memory**: Most importantly, you saw firsthand how managing a single, persistent Session allows an agent to remember context, adapt to user feedback, and conduct a meaningful, multi-turn conversation."
